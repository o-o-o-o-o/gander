  caveats <<~EOS
    Gander is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate.
    On first launch macOS may block it. If that happens, run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Gander.app

    Alternatively, install without quarantine in the first place:
      brew install --no-quarantine --cask gander

    Or go to: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway
